LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:

    Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
    Lower memory usage.
    Better accuracy.
    Support of parallel, distributed, and GPU learning.
    Capable of handling large-scale data.


Benefiting from these advantages, LightGBM is being widely-used in many winning solutions of machine learning competitions.

Comparison experiments on public datasets show that LightGBM can outperform existing boosting frameworks on both efficiency and accuracy, with significantly lower memory consumption. What's more, distributed learning experiments show that LightGBM can achieve a linear speed-up by using multiple machines for training in specific settings.
